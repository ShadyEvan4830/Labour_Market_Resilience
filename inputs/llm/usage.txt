Discussion (New Paper Draft)

Detailed findings

Based on the primary work of Feldman et al. (2017), the original paper demonstrates that a strong belief in free will results in significant increases in job satisfaction; this correlation is relevant across cultural differences and in different work fields (e.g., from Taiwanese real estate agents to American digital Labor) similar results were maintained.

Through this paper, we conducted a secondary survey of institutional beliefs in the digital gig economy (specifically the MTurk community) and sought to determine whether there is a positive relationship between U.S. workersâ€™ beliefs about free will and their job satisfaction with Amazon Mechanical. Based on an analysis of information from a six-month focused study of Amazon MTurk workers presented in the original paper, our results confirm a positive relationship, indicating that workers with a stronger belief in free will tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction. Our analysis shows that the correlation between free will beliefs and job satisfaction is more vital in this digital microtask environment than in a traditional work environment. The above reinforces the idea that institutional beliefs in the increasingly prevalent gig economy are not just philosophical abstractions but have real consequences for workforce well-being.

Theoretical Implications

The findings from our study offer theoretical implications for understanding job satisfaction in the context of the gig economy. Specifically, they suggest that beliefs in free will play a crucial role in shaping workers' perceptions of their autonomy and, consequently, their job satisfaction. This challenges and extends traditional theories of job satisfaction by incorporating the psychological dimension of free will beliefs, especially in flexible work environments like MTurk. It invites a reevaluation of how autonomy is conceptualized and valued in non-traditional work settings, advocating for a broader understanding of factors contributing to job satisfaction. The result is it highlights the importance of creating an environment that enhances employee autonomy, potentially increasing employee engagement and satisfaction.

Journal Study: Work and Freedom in the Context of Agency Beliefs and Job Satisfaction

To further confirm the validity of the original paper and our analysis, we selected another peer-reviewed professional academic journal for reference. By analyzing the comprehensive study conducted by Baldissarri et al. (2017) explored the complex relationship between work activities that trigger self-objectification and subsequent beliefs in personal free will. Through a series of methodologically rigorous studies, this research illustrates that diminished free will beliefs are a result of engaging in repetitive, fragmented, and externally directed tasks. This reduction in belief in free will, mediated by self-objectification, sets up a subtle interplay between the nature of work and the psychological makeup of the worker. Consistent with Feldman et al. Baldissarri et al. (2017) established a link between free will beliefs and job satisfaction. Further emphasis is placed on the complexity of agency within the professional realm.

Our findings suggest that MTurk employees who perceive greater autonomy and personal agency report greater job satisfaction, which resonates with the implications of the work of Baldissarri et al. Routine and piecemeal tasks on MTurk can lead to some form of self-objectification, potentially undermining belief in individual free will and, in turn, job satisfaction. Therefore, the inherent structure of gig work may require strategies that enhance perceptions of free will and personal agency in order to increase job satisfaction.

Ethical Considerations in Long-Term Behavioural Studies

Ethical considerations are crucial in long-term behavioural research, especially when studying beliefs and job satisfaction. In doing so, we focused on the research methods and ethical concerns of the original academic journal Feldman et al. (2017). Feldman et al. took a series of steps to ensure the ethics of the study, including ensuring informed consent, protecting privacy and data security, and providing long-term participant support and opportunities for explanation.

We agree with the above ethically appropriate measures of the original academic journal and believe that the research paid special attention to avoiding any possible adverse psychological effects and ensured that all research standards were met through ethical oversight by the institutional review board. This approach ensures maximum protection of participant well-being during the research process and reinforces our commitment to ethical standards while also improving research quality and participant trust in the research.

Accounting for Bias

In addressing bias within the discussion section of our paper, it's essential to acknowledge that while our study expands on the foundational research by Feldman et al. (2017) in exploring the impact of free will beliefs on job satisfaction, particularly within the digital gig economy of Amazon Mechanical Turk, inherent biases in data collection and analysis could influence the outcomes. Ethical implications and biases naturally emerge in both quantitative and qualitative research. For instance, sampling bias can occur when the study participants are not representative of the broader population intended to be analyzed. This type of bias might be mitigated through strategies such as simple random sampling, ensuring that every individual within the target population has an equal chance of selection. However, challenges such as self-selection bias, where individuals with a strong interest in the topic may be more likely to participate, can skew results. Despite efforts to create a representative sample through demographic balancing, such biases may persist, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Thus, acknowledging these limitations and adopting rigorous methodological safeguards are crucial for enhancing the credibility and applicability of research conclusions.

Analytical Limitations and Future Research Pathways

While our study sheds light on the relationship between free will beliefs and job satisfaction in the context of MTurk, it also highlights several limitations. The unique demographics of MTurk workers and the platform's specific work conditions may not fully extrapolate to the broader gig economy. For instance, platforms like MTurk offer a degree of autonomy by allowing workers to choose tasks; however, this freedom is within the confines of predetermined task parameters and compensation set by the platform. Future research should explore this relationship across diverse gig platforms and investigate the longitudinal effects of free will beliefs on job satisfaction to establish causality. Additionally, examining the interplay between personal autonomy and platform policies could offer insights into optimizing job satisfaction in gig work.

Concluding Observations

Overall, our study sought to determine whether a positive correlation exists between American workers' beliefs in free will and their job satisfaction on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Our results confirmed a positive relationship, indicating that workers with stronger beliefs in free will tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction. This finding is supported by data analysis showing that perceived autonomy, a critical aspect of free will, significantly contributes to this increased satisfaction. These insights validate our hypothesis and highlight the importance of fostering an environment that supports autonomy and personal agency in gig economy platforms like MTurk.

We have a data set with different Likert scale responses, we need descriptive statistic figure, could you give me a style of figures/tables that can best represent this

ChatGPT
When it comes to representing Likert scale responses, which are often used in surveys to measure attitudes or opinions across a range of values, it's important to choose a visualization that accurately reflects the distribution of responses and allows for easy comparison across questions or groups.

Here are a few effective styles of figures and tables for representing Likert scale data:

Stacked Bar Charts: These are useful for showing the proportion of responses for each category within a question. Each bar is segmented into colors that represent different levels of agreement or frequency, making it easy to compare across questions.

Diverging Stacked Bar Charts: This variation is particularly good for Likert scales with a neutral midpoint. Responses are centered around the neutral category, with positive and negative responses diverging from the center. This makes it easy to see the skewness of the responses toward agree or disagree.

Heatmaps: A heatmap can be an effective way to visualize the responses to multiple questions at once, especially if you want to compare patterns across groups or over time. Each cell's color intensity represents the frequency or mean score of responses.

Dot Plots: Dot plots are an alternative to bar charts that can display the frequency or mean score of responses to Likert items. They are particularly useful when you want to include a large number of categories without the chart becoming too crowded.

Cumulative Frequency Graphs: These graphs show the cumulative percentage of respondents who chose each category or a higher one. They can be useful for showing the distribution of agreement or sentiment across several questions or items.

Tables with Descriptive Statistics: For a more traditional and detailed approach, a well-organized table can present mean scores, medians, mode, standard deviations, and response counts for each Likert item. Tables are also useful for including additional statistical tests such as the significance of differences between groups.

When choosing the style, consider what is most important for your audience to take away from the data and what will be the clearest way to present that information. For example, if you want to emphasize the percentage of agreement vs. disagreement, a diverging stacked bar chart might be most effective. If you're showing a large number of Likert items at once, a heatmap might be best. If detailed statistics are important, a comprehensive table might be appropriate.

Help me choose the simplest one and provide me with the code in R language

Here is a simple R code that calculates descriptive statistics from Likert scale responses and generates a stacked bar chart to visually represent the data:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Sample data frame structure for Likert scale responses
# Replace this with your actual dataset
data <- data.frame(
  Q1 = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Q2 = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Q3 = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Q4 = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Q5 = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE)
)

# Convert data to long format for ggplot2
data_long <- data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Question", values_to = "Response")

# Calculate frequencies
data_freq <- data_long %>% 
  group_by(Question, Response) %>% 
  summarise(Frequency = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Calculate percentages
data_freq <- data_freq %>% 
  group_by(Question) %>% 
  mutate(Percent = Frequency / sum(Frequency) * 100) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(data_freq, aes(x = Question, y = Percent, fill = factor(Response))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues", name = "Response") +
  labs(x = "Question", y = "Percentage", title = "Likert Scale Responses") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
This code creates a stacked bar chart where each bar's segments represent the percentage of responses for each category of the Likert scale per question. Make sure to replace the sample dataset with your actual data, and run this code in an R environment. â€‹â€‹
