# The Freedom of Choice in the Gig Economy
Belief in Free Will Positively Predicts Job Satisfaction

## Overview of Paper
This paper is based on Feldman et al.'s (2018) academic paper, which deeply explores how free will beliefs affect job satisfaction in various work environments, with a further special focus on platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and the gig economy.

This research extends its findings to include the impact of cultural and job-specific factors on this relationship, providing new insights into nontraditional work settings. This paper aims to contribute to the broader discussion about the role of personal beliefs in shaping job satisfaction in todayâ€™s gig economy.
