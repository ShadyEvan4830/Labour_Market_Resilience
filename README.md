# Labour Market Resilience
Analysis of Economic Crises on Industry Work Hours in 1998, 2008 and 2020 US General Social Surveys

## Overview of Paper
This paper explores the nuanced impacts of economic crises on labour market dynamics, specifically focusing on how various economic downturns, such as the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, influence work hours across different industries and demographics. Our analysis leverages the dataset "Number of hours worked last week" from decades of the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) and programming R language to examine the labour market's resilience and economic downturn effects.

## File Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- Run `outputs` to view the PDF version of the final paper and related output-cleaned data
- Run `inputs` to check selected data from the original paper, sketches and LLM
- Run `scripts` to review simulation data, clean data, test data and related table data
- Run `original_paper` to view the replication package included with the original paper

## LLM Usage Statement
- `inputs/llm/usage.text` When writing this report, the ChatGPT 4 language model was used to obtain relevant inspiration and suggestions for solving the problem of Non-response Rates in GSS analysis. ChatGPT 4 provides the author with some indicators that can support problems and potential solutions caused by Non-response Rates (please refer to usage.txt for more details); these suggestions inspired the author to choose the current Journal Study: "The impact of nonresponse rates on nonresponse bias: A meta-analysis" serve as additional professional evidence to support labour market analysis relevant conclusions. ChatGPT 4 also provides grammatical and structural correction suggestions for the paper content to ensure more conciseness.
